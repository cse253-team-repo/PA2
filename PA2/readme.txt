2. Run neuralnet.py file in Python to train the network, the main function will train the neural network and report the loss in every epoch, at last, the test set accuracy will be printed
3. Run test.py to generate graphs of the loss curve and the accuracy curve

Note:
1. The .gz data files should be in the same folder as other .py files
